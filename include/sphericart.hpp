/**
 * This function calculates the spherical harmonics and, optionally, their
 * derivatives for a set of 3D points.
 *
 * @param n_samples The number of 3D points for which the spherical harmonics
 *        will be calculated.
 * @param l_max The maximum degree of the spherical harmonics to be calculated.
 * @param prefactors Prefactors for the spherical harmonics as computed by the
 *        `compute_sph_prefactors` function.
 * @param xyz An array of size `(n_samples)*3`. It contains the Cartesian
 *        coordinates of the 3D points for which the spherical harmonics are to
 *        be computed, organized along two dimensions. The outer dimension is
 *        `n_samples` long, accounting for different samples, while the inner
 *        dimension has size 3 and it represents the x, y, and z coordinates
 *        respectively.
 * @param sph On entry, a (possibly uninitialized) array of size
 *        `n_samples*(l_max+1)*(l_max+1)`. On exit, this array will contain
 *        the spherical harmonics organized along two dimensions. The leading
 *        dimension is `n_samples` long and it represents the different
 *        samples, while the inner dimension is `(l_max+1)*(l_max+1)` long and
 *        it contains the spherical harmonics. These are laid out in
 *        lexicographic order. For example, if `l_max=2`, it will contain
 *        `(l, m) = (0, 0), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0),
 *        (2, 1), (2, 2)`, in this order.
 * @param dsph On entry, either `NULL` or a (possibly uninitialized) array of
 *        size `n_samples*3*(l_max+1)*(l_max+1)`. If `dsph` is `NULL`, the
 *        spherical harmonics' derivatives will not be calculated. Otherwise, on
 *        exit, this array will contain the spherical harmonics' derivatives
 *        organized along three dimensions. As for the `sph` parameter, the
 *        leading dimension represents the different samples, while the
 *        inner-most dimension is `(l_max+1)*(l_max+1)`, and it represents the
 *        degree and order of the spherical harmonics (again, organized in
 *        lexicographic order). The intermediate dimension corresponds to
 *        different spatial derivatives of the spherical harmonics: x, y, and z,
 *        respectively.
