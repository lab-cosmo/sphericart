JAX
---

The `JAX` implementation consists of the ``sphericart.jax.spherical_harmonics()``
function, which fits within idiomatic JAX code much better than the
corresponding `Python` or `PyTorch` classes.
The example shows how to compute spherical harmonics with the aforementioned
function, as well as how to transform it with standard JAX transformations
such as ``jax.vmap()``, ``jax.grad()``, ``jax.jit()`` and others.
