``sphericart`` is a multi-language library for the efficient calculation of 
spherical harmonics and their derivatives in Cartesian coordinates. 

The theory behind this efficient implementation is detailed in this 
`paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08381>`_. 

The core library is implemented in C++ with OpenMP parallelism, and it provides 
APIs for C, Python and PyTorch. In addition, the PyTorch-based implementation 
provides fast spherical harmonics evaluations on GPUs using CUDA.

This documentation contains an installation guide, an API overview, some examples
of how to use the library, and a brief explanation of the mathematics involved.
