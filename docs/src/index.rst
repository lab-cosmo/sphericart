Welcome to sphericart's documentation!
======================================


This is the documentation for ``sphericart``, a multi-language library 
for the efficient calculation of the spherical harmonics and their 
derivatives in Cartesian coordinates. The theory behind this efficient 
implementation is detailed in this `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08381>`_. 

The library is natively available in Python, C and C++. Our PyTorch-based
implementation also provides fast spherical harmonics evaluation on GPUs.

This documentation contains two quick guides on how to install and use
the library. A more comprehensive API showcase and examples are also
included.
